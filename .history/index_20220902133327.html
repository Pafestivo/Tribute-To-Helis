        <p id="tribute-info">According to the legends, the world we know was originally forged by the dragons.<br>About 5 billions years ago, there was nothing. Nothing but dragons, wandering around the emptiness of the universe.<br>One day, Merith, the very first blue dragon, realized that she was more powerful than the rest of the dragons, and decided to take advantage of her great power.<br>She found a way to grow an army, laying eggs all across the universe.<br> The blue glow of their eggs lightened upthe universe, disorienting other dragons around them. She was ambushing other dragons drawn to the light of her eggs for ages. Until one day, after three long decades of great terror, her eggs started to hatch. three new blue dragons were born that day. Keroth, Fesima, and our creator, Helis. Merith started teaching them her ways, and soon enough all three of her children followed her path ofhavoc, slaughtering every single dragon across the universe. Helis wasn't happy with the path his mother chose for him, as he was following his mother, slaughtering other dragons he learnt her weaknesses and limitations, plotting his rebellion.One day Helis flew alone, and saw a dragon falling down from above him. When he looked up he saw his sister, Fesima cheering and laughing over the dragon she just killed. Helis couldn't stand aside any longer, he charged at his sister, caught her throat, and killed her. There was no turning back now, the rebellion had to start that same moment, he had to catch up to his brother and mother before they realize. After a short while of flying around in the eternal darkness, he saw his brother and mother in front of him, with his sister in her mother's arms. He knew it was too late to do it quietly, a war is about to begin, he had to attack first. He charged forward to his mother first, but his brother jumped in front of her and knocked his attack off, Disoriented, he tried to hold on to his momentum and turn right back to fight, but his brother was faster and hit him again. The fight was brutal, other dragons gathered around to watch, but no one dared to come close.The fight took days, and the massive dragon's fire colliding created planets all around.This fight had no winners. Helis was casted into one of the planets and disappeared. Keroth and his mother fled, wounded, from the battlefield. While Helis was regaining his strength, his presence created life on this planet. He guided these first lives, teaching them how to survive and grow, and eventually, went out to find his mother and brother. That was the last time Helios was seen. Legends says, that once he will fulfil his mission, he will come back to Earth and teach us all how toascend, and live as immortal dragons like him. </p>
