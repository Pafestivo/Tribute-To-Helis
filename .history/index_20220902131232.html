        <p id="tribute-info" class="center-txt">According to the legends, the world we know was originally forged by the dragons.<br>About 5 billions years ago, there was nothing. Nothing but dragons, wandering around the emptiness of the universe.<br>One day, Merith, the very first blue dragon, the mother of Helis, realized that she was more powerful<br> than the rest, and decided to take advantage of her great power.<br>She started multiplying herself. Laying eggs all across the universe. The blue glow of their eggs lightened up<br>the universe, disorienting other dragons around them.<br> She was ambushing other dragons drawn to the light of her eggs for ages. Until one day, after three long decades<br> of great terror, her eggs started to hatch.<br> three new blue dragons were born that day. Keroth, Fesima, and our creator, Helis.<br> Merith started teaching them her ways, and soon enough all three of her children followed her path of<br>havoc, slaughtering every single dragon across the universe.<br> Helis wasn't happy with the path his mother chose for him, as he<br> was following his mother, slaughtering other dragons he learnt her weaknesses and limitations, plotting his rebellion.<br>One day Helis flew alone, and saw a dragon falling down from above him.<br> When he looked up he saw his sister, Fesima cheering and laughing over the dragon she just killed.<br> Helis couldn't stand aside any longer, he charged at his sister, caught her throat, and killed her.<br> There was no turning back now, the rebellion had to start that same moment, he had to catch up to his brother and mother before they realize.<br> After a short while of flying around in the eternal darkness, he saw his brother and mother in front of him, with his sister in her mother's arms.<br> He knew it was too late to do it quietly, a war is about to begin, he had to attack first. </p>
