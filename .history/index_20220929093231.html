        <p id="tribute-info">According to the legends, the world we know was originally forged by the dragons.<br>About 5 billions years ago, there was nothing. Nothing but dragons, wandering around the emptiness of the universe.<br>One day, Merith, the very first blue dragon, realized that she was more powerful than the rest of the dragons, and decided to take advantage of her great power.<br>She found a way to grow an army, laying eggs all across the universe.<br> The blue glow of their eggs lightened up the universe, disorienting other dragons around them.<br> She used to ambush other dragons disoriented by the light of her eggs for ages.<br> one day, after three long decades of great terror, her eggs started to hatch. three blue dragons were born that day- Keroth, Fesima, and our creator, Helis.<br> Merith started teaching them her ways, and soon enough all three of her children followed her path of havoc, slaughtering every single dragon across the universe.<br> Helis wasn't happy with the path his mother chose for him.<br> As he was following his mother, he observed and learnt her limits and weaknesses.<br>One day Helis flew around, and saw a dragon falling down from above him. When he looked up he saw his sister, Fesima cheering and laughing over the dragon she just killed.<br> Helis couldn't stand aside any longer, he charged at his sister, caught her by the throat, and killed her. There was no turning back now, at this very moment, he knew what he has to do.<br> He had to catch up to his brother and mother before they realize. After a short while of flying around in the eternal darkness, he saw them, right in front of him. His mother was holding Fesima.<br> He knew he had to act now, a war has just started, he had to strike first.<br> He charged forward at his mother, but his brother jumped in front of her and knocked him off balance.<br> Disoriented, he tried to hold on to his momentum and turn right back to the fight, but his brother was faster and hit him again. The fight was brutal, other dragons gathered around to watch, but no one dared to come close. <br> The fight went on for hours. The massive dragon's fire created planets all around them. There were no winners. Helis was casted into one of the planets and disappeared. Keroth and his mother fled, wounded, from the battlefield.<br> While Helis was regaining his strength, his presence created life on the planet. He guided those new lives, teaching them and helping them grow, and eventually, went back out there to find his family and bring this to an end. That was the very last time Helios was seen.<br> Legends says, that once he will fulfil his destiny, he will come back to Earth and help us all ascend, and live with him as dragons among the stars. </p>
